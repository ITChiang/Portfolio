const introText =`I am I-Tung Chiang, a designer, programmer, and traveler born and raised in Taiwan, keep finding and chasing the beautiful stuff in this world. And dream one day could build something that can solve people's problem in a smoothly way.

Recently, I finished my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Yuan Ze University and LinkÃ¶ping University in Sweden, where I have learned all the ability that a good programmer needed. Before I came to Carnegie Mellon University, I was working as a web developer at Music and Audio Computing Lab, Academia Sinica.

Currently, I am a second-year student studying in the master of entertainment at Carnegie Mellon University.

Besides working and studying, I always enjoy a good cup of milk tea, playing games, and every kind of water sports.`;
