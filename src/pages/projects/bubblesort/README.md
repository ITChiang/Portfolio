>>> Customer delivering page

We used React as our front-end framework since React is one of the popular frameworks now, and we want to explore new technology in this project. We choose Django REST framework for back-end, we learned Django in the course, and we think it will be less workload for us. We communicate front-end to back-end using Axios, which is Javascript library support sending XMLHttpRequests and making HTTP requests. For deployments, we select Heroku as our platform. Heroku is good for small projects and easy for deployment. It requires less maintenance and provides a steady connection.

## Cooperation 

As three students team, we divide tasks into several parts. Respectively are customer view parts, owner view parts, and back-end server. I mainly in charge of the customer parts, which includes drink ordering and store searching etc.. We used git as the version controlling tool. Since we are not experts of git, we faced some merge issues at the end of the development stage. However, I learned a lot about Scrum and getting familiar with teamwork patterns in software engineering.
