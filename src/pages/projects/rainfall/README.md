## About 

This web page is an interactive graphics design project implement by React and Three.js.

## Inspiration

There are many radio sites in youtube with infinite loop gif images, and many videos especially like raining scenes. This gave me an idea, so I built this interactive website that combines rain and waterfall. Watching random squares fall might find a trace of inner peace.
