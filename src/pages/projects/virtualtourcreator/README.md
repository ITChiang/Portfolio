## About the Project 

In the summer of 2020, I got the opportunity to work on a student team to deliver an internship project for a real client. I was a front-end and UX engineer in the team and mainly responsible for the front-end development. 

We designed and built a tool to enable museum staff to execute virtual museum experiences for their guests during the project. These live virtual experiences will be conducted through a digital platform, such as Zoom, and enhanced by our web-based tool.
